# HAVE_DOT

A HAVE_DOT is a technique used to create images by arranging small
dots in a specific pattern. This technique is often used in scientific
illustration for subtle, natural shading and can also be used in artistic
creations and textile design.

## HAVE_DOT

If you set the HAVE_DOT tag to YES then Doxygen will assume the dot tool
is available from the path. This tool is part of `Graphviz`, a graph
visualization toolkit from `AT&T and Lucent Bell Labs`. The other options
in this section have no effect if this option is set to NO

`The default value is: NO.`

## How is it Done?

The process of creating a `HAVE_DOT `image involves using a grid of tiny dots,
which are then arranged in a specific pattern to create the desired image.
This can be done using various methods, such as:

- `Stippling`: A technique where small dots are arranged in a specific pattern
  to create an image. This technique is often used in scientific illustration
  `for subtle, natural shading`.
- `Halftone`: A process where an image is broken up into tiny dots that appear
  to blend into a continuous tone when viewed with the naked eye.

## Examples of HAVE_DOT in Simple Images

- **Scientific illustrations:** HAVE_DOT is often used in scientific illustration
  to create detailed and realistic images of biological and anatomical structures.

- **Artistic creations:** HAVE_DOT can be used to create unique and detailed
  artistic creations, such as portraits, landscapes, and abstract designs.
- **Textile design:** HAVE_DOT can be used to create intricate and detailed designs
  for textiles, such as fabrics and wallpapers.
