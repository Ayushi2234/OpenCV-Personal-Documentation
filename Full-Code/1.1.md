```python
import cv2 as cv
import numpy as np
import os

# Ensure the file exists
assert os.path.exists("images/messi.jpg"), "File wasn't found, check the path."

# Read the image
img = cv.imread("images/messi.jpg")

# Check if the image was loaded correctly
assert img is not None, "Image loading failed."

# Extract the pixel value at (100, 100)
pixel_value = img[100, 100]
print(f"Pixel value at (100, 100): {pixel_value}")

# Display the image (not just a pixel)
cv.imshow("Messi Image", img)
cv.waitKey(0)
cv.destroyAllWindows()
```

### Explanation:
- **`os.path.exists("images/messi.jpg")`**: This is used to check if the file exists before trying to read it.
- **`img[100, 100]`**: Retrieves the pixel value at `(100, 100)`. You might want to print or inspect this value instead of trying to display it.
- **`cv.imshow("Messi Image", img)`**: Displays the entire image using a window named `"Messi Image"`.

This code should work as expected, displaying the entire image and printing the pixel value at the specified coordinates.
