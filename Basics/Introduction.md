### Introduction

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open-source library that provides a comprehensive collection of algorithms for computer vision applications. This document discusses the OpenCV 2.x API, which is a C++ API replacing the older C-based OpenCV 1.x API (the C API is deprecated and not tested with the "C" compiler since OpenCV 2.4 releases).

### Modular Structure of OpenCV

OpenCV is designed with a modular structure, meaning it consists of several shared or static libraries. Each module provides a specific set of functionalities:

- **Core functionality (core)**: This module defines basic data structures and fundamental functions used by all other modules. It includes the dense multi-dimensional array `Mat` and other essential elements.
- **Image Processing (imgproc)**: This module includes various image processing algorithms such as linear and non-linear image filtering, geometrical image transformations (resize, affine and perspective warping, generic table-based remapping), color space conversion, histograms, and more.
- **Video Analysis (video)**: This module provides algorithms for video analysis, including motion estimation, background subtraction, and object tracking.
- **Camera Calibration and 3D Reconstruction (calib3d)**: It contains basic multiple-view geometry algorithms, single and stereo camera calibration, object pose estimation, stereo correspondence algorithms, and elements of 3D reconstruction.
- **2D Features Framework (features2d)**: This module includes salient feature detectors, descriptors, and descriptor matchers.
- **Object Detection (objdetect)**: It provides functionalities for detecting objects and instances of predefined classes, such as faces, eyes, mugs, people, and cars.
- **High-level GUI (highgui)**: This module offers an easy-to-use interface for simple UI capabilities.
- **Video I/O (videoio)**: It provides an interface for video capturing and video codecs.
- **Other helper modules**: These include FLANN, Google test wrappers, Python bindings, and others.

`FLANN` or Fast Library for Approximate Nearest Neighbors, is a library used for performing fast approximate nearest neighbor searches in high dimensional spaces.

Each of these modules has a specific purpose and provides a set of functionalities to perform various computer vision tasks. The subsequent sections of the document describe the functionality of each module in detail. However, it is important to first understand the common API concepts used throughout the library.

- `API (Application Programming Interface)`: A set of definitions and protocols that enables two software components to communicate with each other, allowing data and functionality to be exchanged over the internet.

### API Concepts

#### `cv` Namespace

All OpenCV classes and functions are contained within the `cv` namespace. This helps to avoid name conflicts with other libraries. To access OpenCV functionalities in your code, you need to use the `cv::` specifier or the `using namespace cv;` directive.

Example:
```cpp
#include "opencv2/core.hpp"

// Using the cv:: specifier
cv::Mat H = cv::findHomography(points1, points2, cv::RANSAC, 5);

// Using the using directive
#include "opencv2/core.hpp"
using namespace cv;
Mat H = findHomography(points1, points2, RANSAC, 5);
```
`Some details :`
1. what is cv::Mat

OpenCV’s cv::Mat is a multi-dimensional array class that 
represents a matrix of numbers. It is the fundamental data 
structure in OpenCV. You can think of it as a matrix or an image in computer vision.

2. What is findHomography?

findHomography is a function in OpenCV that finds a perspective transformation [homography](https://github.com/shyama7004/OpenCV-Personal-Documentation/new/main/readme.md/Other%20Defs) between two planes. It takes two sets of points, points1 and points2, and returns a matrix H that represents the homography.

Arguments:

points1 and points2: These are two sets of points that represent the planes in the source and destination images, respectively.
cv::RANSAC: This is the RANSAC (Random Sample Consensus) algorithm, which is used to find the best-fitting homography.
5: This is the maximum allowed reprojection error to treat a point pair as an inlier (used in the RANSAC method only).

3. What does cv::RANSAC do?

cv::RANSAC is an algorithm that is used to find the best-fitting homography between two sets of points. It works by randomly selecting a subset of the points and estimating the homography matrix using a least-squares algorithm. The algorithm then computes the quality/goodness of the computed homography (which is the number of inliers for RANSAC).

How does cv::RANSAC work?

cv::RANSAC works by trying many different random subsets of the corresponding point pairs (of four pairs each, collinear pairs are discarded). It estimates the homography matrix using this subset and a simple least-squares algorithm, and then computes the quality/goodness of the computed homography.

What is the output?

The output of findHomography is a matrix H that represents the homography between the two planes. This matrix can be used to transform points from the source plane to the destination plane.

In summary, cv::Mat H = cv::findHomography(points1, points2, cv::RANSAC, 5); finds a perspective transformation (homography) between two planes using the RANSAC algorithm, with a maximum allowed reprojection error of 5. The output is a matrix H that represents the homography.


Sometimes, OpenCV names may conflict with STL or other libraries. In such cases, use explicit namespace specifiers to resolve conflicts:
```cpp
Mat a(100, 100, CV_32F);
randu(a, Scalar::all(1), Scalar::all(std::rand()));
cv::log(a, a);
a /= std::log(2.);
```
### Line by Line Explanation

#### `Mat a(100, 100, CV_32F);`
This line creates a 100x100 matrix `a` of type `CV_32F`, which means each element in the matrix is a 32-bit floating-point number.

- `Mat` is the main OpenCV class for matrix storage.
- `100, 100` specifies the number of rows and columns in the matrix, respectively.
- `CV_32F` indicates the type of the elements in the matrix (32-bit floating point).

#### `randu(a, Scalar::all(1), Scalar::all(std::rand()));`
This line fills the matrix `a` with random values uniformly distributed between 1 and a random integer generated by `std::rand()`.

- `randu` is an OpenCV function that fills the matrix with uniformly distributed random numbers.
- `a` is the matrix to be filled with random numbers.
- `Scalar::all(1)` represents the lower bound of the random values, which is 1.
- `Scalar::all(std::rand())` represents the upper bound of the random values, which is a random integer generated by the C++ standard library function `std::rand()`.

#### `cv::log(a, a);`
This line computes the natural logarithm of each element in the matrix `a` and stores the result back in `a`.

- `cv::log` is an OpenCV function that calculates the natural logarithm of each element in the input matrix.
- The first `a` is the input matrix.
- The second `a` is the output matrix, which will store the result. In this case, the input matrix and output matrix are the same, so the logarithm is computed in place.

#### `a /= std::log(2.);`
This line divides each element in the matrix `a` by the natural logarithm of 2.

- `a /= std::log(2.);` is shorthand for `a = a / std::log(2.);`
- `std::log(2.)` computes the natural logarithm of 2, which is a constant value approximately equal to 0.693147.
- This operation converts the natural logarithm values in `a` to base-2 logarithm values, because dividing by `log(2)` effectively changes the base of the logarithm from `e` (natural logarithm) to `2` (logarithm base 2).


#### Automatic Memory Management

OpenCV handles memory management automatically, making it easier to work with complex data structures without worrying about manual memory allocation and deallocation.

- **Destructors**: Data structures like `std::vector`, `cv::Mat`, and others have destructors that deallocate memory when needed. In the case of `cv::Mat`, the destructor decrements the reference counter associated with the matrix data buffer. The buffer is only deallocated when the reference counter reaches zero, ensuring that memory is shared efficiently.

`A reference counter` is a mechanism used to keep track of the number of references to an object or a resource in a program. It is a common technique used in memory management, particularly in languages that use garbage collection, such as Java and C#.

- **Copying and Cloning**: When a `cv::Mat` instance is copied, the reference counter is incremented, and no actual data is copied. The `cv::Mat::clone` method creates a full copy of the matrix data.

Example:
```cpp
// Create a big 8MB matrix
Mat A(1000, 1000, CV_64F);

// Create another header for the same matrix
Mat B = A;

// Create another header for the 3rd row of A
Mat C = B.row(3);

// Create a separate copy of the matrix
Mat D = B.clone();

// Copy the 5th row of B to C
B.row(5).copyTo(C);

// Share data between A and D
A = D;

// Make B an empty matrix
B.release();

// Make a full copy of C
C = C.clone();
```

For high-level classes or user data types created without considering automatic memory management, OpenCV provides the `cv::Ptr` template class, similar to `std::shared_ptr` from C++11.

Example:
```cpp
// Using plain pointers
T* ptr = new T(...);

// Using cv::Ptr
Ptr<T> ptr(new T(...));

// Using makePtr
Ptr<T> ptr = makePtr<T>(...);
```

#### Automatic Allocation of Output Data

OpenCV functions often automatically allocate memory for output parameters based on the input parameters. This simplifies the function usage as the size and type of the output arrays are determined from the input arrays.

Example:
```cpp
#include "opencv2/imgproc.hpp"
#include "opencv2/highgui.hpp"

using namespace cv;

int main(int, char**)
{
    VideoCapture cap(0);
    if (!cap.isOpened()) return -1;

    Mat frame, edges;
    namedWindow("edges", WINDOW_AUTOSIZE);
    for (;;)
    {
        cap >> frame;
        cvtColor(frame, edges, COLOR_BGR2GRAY);
        GaussianBlur(edges, edges, Size(7,7), 1.5, 1.5);
        Canny(edges, edges, 0, 30, 3);
        imshow("edges", edges);
        if (waitKey(30) >= 0) break;
    }
    return 0;
}
```
This code is a simple C++ program using OpenCV to capture video from a webcam and apply edge detection to each frame in real time. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Include necessary headers:**
   ```cpp
   #include "opencv2/imgproc.hpp"
   #include "opencv2/highgui.hpp"
   ```
   These headers include the functions for image processing (`imgproc.hpp`) and for creating graphical user interfaces (`highgui.hpp`).

2. **Using the `cv` namespace:**
   ```cpp
   using namespace cv;
   ```
   This allows you to use OpenCV functions and classes without prefixing them with `cv::`.

3. **Main function:**
   ```cpp
   int main(int, char**)
   ```
   The main function of the program. It doesn't use its arguments, hence the empty parameters.
   ```
   int main(int argc, char** argv)
   ```
This is a common way to declare the main function in C++. It takes two parameters:

- `int argc`: This stands for "argument count". It represents the number of command-line arguments passed to the program, including the name of the program itself.
- `char** argv`: This stands for "argument vector". It is an array of C-style strings (character arrays) representing the actual arguments.

5. **Video capture:**
   ```cpp
   VideoCapture cap(0);
   if (!cap.isOpened()) return -1;
   ```
   This creates a `VideoCapture` object to capture video from the default camera (device index `0`). If the camera is not opened successfully, the program returns `-1`.

6. **Create matrices for frames and edges:**
   ```cpp
   Mat frame, edges;
   ```
   `Mat` is a matrix data type in OpenCV used to store image data. `frame` will store the captured frame, and `edges` will store the processed frame with edge detection applied.

7. **Create a window to display the edges:**
   ```cpp
   namedWindow("edges", WINDOW_AUTOSIZE);
   ```
   This creates a window named "edges" for displaying the processed frames. `WINDOW_AUTOSIZE` makes sure the window size adjusts to the size of the displayed image.

8. **Main processing loop:**
   ```cpp
   for (;;)
   ```
   This is an infinite loop that processes each frame from the video stream.

9. **Capture and process each frame:**
   ```cpp
   cap >> frame;
   cvtColor(frame, edges, COLOR_BGR2GRAY);
   GaussianBlur(edges, edges, Size(7,7), 1.5, 1.5);
   Canny(edges, edges, 0, 30, 3);
   imshow("edges", edges);
   ```
   - `cap >> frame;`: Captures a frame from the video stream and stores it in `frame`.
   - `cvtColor(frame, edges, COLOR_BGR2GRAY);`: Converts the captured frame from BGR color space to grayscale.
   - `GaussianBlur(edges, edges, Size(7,7), 1.5, 1.5);`: Applies a Gaussian blur to the grayscale image to reduce noise and detail. The `Size(7,7)` specifies the kernel size, and `1.5, 1.5` are the standard deviations in the x and y directions.

      In the context of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the kernel size refers to the size of the small matrix used for blurring, sharpening, embossing, edge detection, and more. 

   - `Canny(edges, edges, 0, 30, 3);`: Applies the Canny edge detector to the blurred image. The parameters `0` and `30` are the thresholds for edge detection, and `3` is the aperture size for the Sobel operator.
  `The Sobel operator` is a discrete differentiation operator that computes an approximation of the gradient of an image intensity function.

  - `imshow("edges", edges);`: Displays the processed image in the window named "edges".

10. **Exit on key press:**
   ```cpp
   if (waitKey(30) >= 0) break;
   ```
   `waitKey(30)` waits for 30 milliseconds for a key press. If a key is pressed (indicated by the return value being non-negative), the loop breaks and the program exits.

11. **Return from main:**
    ```cpp
    return 0;
    ```
    The program returns `0` to indicate successful completion.

#### Saturation Arithmetic

Saturation arithmetic is used to handle image pixels encoded in compact 8- or 16-bit forms, ensuring values remain within their range to prevent visual artifacts. OpenCV uses the `cv::saturate_cast<>` function to achieve this.

Example:
```cpp
I.at<uchar>(y, x) = saturate_cast<uchar>(r);
```
For more details click on this :[saturate_cast<uchar>](https://github.com/shyama7004/OpenCV-Personal-Documentation/blob/main/readme.md/Other%20Defs/saturate_cast%3Cuchar%3E.md)

In optimized SIMD code, instructions like `paddusb` and `packuswb` achieve the same behavior as in C++ code.

`SIMD` stands for “Single Instruction, Multiple Data” and is a computing paradigm in which a single instruction processes multiple data.

`Note`: Saturation is not applied when the result is a 32-bit integer.

#### Fixed Pixel Types and Limited Use of Templates

OpenCV supports a fixed set of primitive data types:
- 8-bit unsigned integer (`uchar`)
- 8-bit signed integer (`schar`)
- 16-bit unsigned integer (`ushort`)
- 16-bit signed integer (`short`)
- 32-bit signed integer (`int`)
- 32-bit floating-point number (`float`)
- 64-bit floating-point number (`double`)
- Tuples of the above types for multi-channel arrays (e.g., `CV_8UC3` for a 3-channel 8-bit unsigned integer array).

Enumeration of types:
```cpp
enum { CV_8U=0, CV_8S=1, CV_16U=2, CV_16S=3, CV_32S=4, CV_32F=5, CV_64F=6 };
```

Multi-channel types:
```cpp
CV_8UC1 ... CV_64FC4 // Constants for 1 to 4 channels
CV_8UC(n) ... CV_64FC(n) // Macros for more than 4 channels
CV_MAKETYPE(CV_8U, n) // Macro to create type with n channels
```

Example:
```cpp
Mat mtx(3, 3, CV_32F); // 3x3 floating-point matrix
Mat cmtx(10, 1, CV_64FC2); // 10x1 2-channel floating-point matrix
Mat img(Size(1920, 1080), CV_8UC3); // 3-channel color image
Mat grayscale(img.size(), CV_MAKETYPE(img.depth(), 1)); // 1-channel image
```

#### InputArray and OutputArray

OpenCV functions process dense numerical arrays using `cv::Mat`. To avoid API duplication, OpenCV introduces proxy classes like `cv::InputArray` for read-only arrays and `cv::OutputArray` for output arrays. These proxies handle various data types seamlessly.

Sure, let's break down the provided code:

```cpp
void someFunction(InputArray _src, OutputArray _dst)
{
    Mat src = _src.getMat();
    Mat dst = _dst.getMat();
    // Processing...
}
```

### Explanation

This function, `someFunction`, takes two parameters: an `InputArray` and an `OutputArray`. These parameters are designed to handle various types of data in a flexible and efficient manner.

#### Function Declaration

```cpp
void someFunction(InputArray _src, OutputArray _dst)
```

- **void**: The function does not return any value.
- **someFunction**: The name of the function.
- **InputArray _src**: A parameter representing the input data. `InputArray` is a proxy class in OpenCV that can represent various types of input data such as `Mat`, `std::vector<Mat>`, etc.
- **OutputArray _dst**: A parameter representing the output data. `OutputArray` is a proxy class in OpenCV that can represent various types of output data such as `Mat`, `std::vector<Mat>`, etc.

#### Body of the Function

```cpp
Mat src = _src.getMat();
Mat dst = _dst.getMat();
```

- **Mat src = _src.getMat();**: Converts the `InputArray` `_src` to an OpenCV `Mat` object named `src`. The `getMat()` method is used to retrieve the `Mat` object from the `InputArray`.
- **Mat dst = _dst.getMat();**: Converts the `OutputArray` `_dst` to an OpenCV `Mat` object named `dst`. The `getMat()` method is used to retrieve the `Mat` object from the `OutputArray`.

### Why Use InputArray and OutputArray?

#### Flexibility

By using `InputArray` and `OutputArray`, OpenCV functions can handle multiple types of input and output data without needing to overload the function for each data type. This makes the API more flexible and easier to use.

#### Example

Here is a more detailed example that shows how `someFunction` might be used:

```cpp
void someFunction(InputArray _src, OutputArray _dst)
{
    Mat src = _src.getMat();
    Mat dst = _dst.getMat();
    // Example Processing: Convert the source image to grayscale
    cvtColor(src, dst, COLOR_BGR2GRAY);
}

int main()
{
    Mat colorImage = imread("color_image.jpg"); // Load a color image
    Mat grayImage; // Create an empty Mat for the grayscale image

    // Call the function
    someFunction(colorImage, grayImage);

    // Display the result
    imshow("Grayscale Image", grayImage);
    waitKey(0);

    return 0;
}
```

In this example:

1. **Load a color image**: `Mat colorImage = imread("color_image.jpg");`
2. **Create an empty Mat for the grayscale image**: `Mat grayImage;`
3. **Call `someFunction` with the color image and the empty grayscale image**: `someFunction(colorImage, grayImage);`
4. **Convert the source image to grayscale inside `someFunction`**: `cvtColor(src, dst, COLOR_BGR2GRAY);`
5. **Display the result**: `imshow("Grayscale Image", grayImage);`

### Summary

- **`InputArray` and `OutputArray`** are used to handle various types of input and output data in a flexible way.
- **`getMat()`** method converts these proxy objects into OpenCV `Mat` objects.
- This approach simplifies function declarations and usage, making the API more versatile.


#### Error Handling

OpenCV uses exceptions to signal critical errors. These exceptions are instances of the `cv::Exception` class or its derivatives, which in turn derive from `std::exception`.

Example:
```cpp
try
{
    // Call OpenCV function
}
catch (const cv::Exception& e)
{
    const char* err_msg = e.what();
    std::cout << "Exception caught: " << err_msg<< std::endl;
}
```
This code snippet demonstrates how to handle exceptions in C++ when using OpenCV. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Try Block:**
   ```cpp
   try
   {
       // Call OpenCV function
   }
   ```
   - The `try` block contains code that might throw an exception. In this case, it would be an OpenCV function that might fail and throw an exception.

2. **Catch Block:**
   ```cpp
   catch (const cv::Exception& e)
   {
       const char* err_msg = e.what();
       std::cout << "Exception caught: " << err_msg << std::endl;
   }
   ```
   - The `catch` block handles exceptions thrown by the code within the `try` block. It specifically catches exceptions of type `cv::Exception`, which is the base class for exceptions thrown by OpenCV functions.
   - `const cv::Exception& e`: This catches the exception by reference, allowing access to the exception object `e`.
   - `e.what()`: This member function of `cv::Exception` returns a C-style string describing the error.
   - `const char* err_msg = e.what();`: Stores the error message in a `const char*` variable `err_msg`.
   - `std::cout << "Exception caught: " << err_msg << std::endl;`: Outputs the error message to the standard output (usually the console), indicating that an exception has been caught and displaying the error message.

### Detailed Steps:

1. **Execution of OpenCV Function:**
   - Within the `try` block, you would call an OpenCV function that might potentially fail. For example:
     ```cpp
     try
     {
         Mat img = imread("nonexistent_file.jpg"); // This might throw an exception if the file does not exist
     }
     ```
   - If the function call succeeds, the program continues normally.
   - If the function call fails and throws a `cv::Exception`, control is transferred to the `catch` block.

2. **Handling the Exception:**
   - The `catch` block catches the `cv::Exception` and extracts the error message using `e.what()`.
   - The error message is then printed to the console, providing information about what went wrong.

### Example Scenario:

Suppose you have a piece of code that attempts to read an image file. If the file doesn't exist or can't be read for some reason, OpenCV's `imread` function might throw an exception. Here's how the code would look with exception handling:

```cpp
try
{
    Mat img = imread("nonexistent_file.jpg");
    // Further processing with img
}
catch (const cv::Exception& e)
{
    const char* err_msg = e.what();
    std::cout << "Exception caught: " << err_msg << std::endl;
}
```

- If the file `nonexistent_file.jpg` doesn't exist, `imread` will fail and throw a `cv::Exception`.
- The `catch` block will catch this exception, extract the error message, and print it to the console.

### Benefits:

- **Robustness:** Handling exceptions makes your code more robust and less likely to crash unexpectedly.
- **Error Information:** By printing the error message, you can get detailed information about what went wrong, which is useful for debugging.
- **Graceful Degradation:** Even if an error occurs, your program can handle it gracefully without crashing, possibly allowing you to take corrective actions or inform the user appropriately.

In critical applications, prefer using C++ standard mechanisms like assertions or custom handlers.

Example:

```cpp
  CV_Assert(condition);
  CV_Error(cv::Error::StsBadArg, "Error message");
```

#### Multi-threading and Re-enterability

OpenCV is designed to be fully re-enterable, allowing the same functions or methods of different class instances to be called from different threads without issues. OpenCV uses architecture-specific atomic operations for reference counting, making `cv::Mat` instances safe across threads. This thread safety extends to other high-level OpenCV classes that manage their own buffers.

Example:
```cpp
Mat A = ...;
Mat B = ...;
#pragma omp parallel sections
{
    #pragma omp section
    {
        Mat C = A * 5;
        C.copyTo(B);
    }
    #pragma omp section
    {
        Mat D = B.t();
        D.copyTo(A);
    }
}
```

This code snippet demonstrates parallel processing in C++ using OpenMP with OpenCV matrices. Here's a detailed breakdown:

### Parallel Sections with OpenMP

OpenMP (`Open Multi-Processing`) is an API that supports multi-platform shared memory multiprocessing programming in C, C++, and Fortran. It allows developers to write code that can run in parallel on multiple processors.

### Breakdown of the Code

1. **Define Matrices A and B:**
   ```cpp
   Mat A = ...;
   Mat B = ...;
   ```
   `Mat` is an OpenCV data type used for storing images or matrices. `A` and `B` are matrices, but their initialization is not shown in the snippet.

2. **OpenMP Parallel Sections:**
   ```cpp
   #pragma omp parallel sections
   {
   ```
   The `#pragma omp parallel sections` directive creates a parallel region in which the enclosed sections are executed in parallel. Each section runs in its own thread.

3. **First Parallel Section:**
   ```cpp
   #pragma omp section
   {
       Mat C = A * 5;
       C.copyTo(B);
   }
   ```
   - `#pragma omp section`: This directive indicates the beginning of a parallel section.
   - `Mat C = A * 5;`: This creates a new matrix `C` by multiplying each element of matrix `A` by 5.
   - `C.copyTo(B);`: The result stored in `C` is copied to matrix `B`.

4. **Second Parallel Section:**
   ```cpp
   #pragma omp section
   {
       Mat D = B.t();
       D.copyTo(A);
   }
   ```
   - `#pragma omp section`: This directive indicates another parallel section.
   - `Mat D = B.t();`: This creates a new matrix `D` which is the transpose of matrix `B`.
   - `D.copyTo(A);`: The result stored in `D` is copied to matrix `A`.

### Summary of Execution

- The `#pragma omp parallel sections` directive creates a parallel region where the two enclosed sections are executed concurrently.
- The first section multiplies matrix `A` by 5 and stores the result in `B`.
- The second section takes the transpose of matrix `B` and stores the result in `A`.

### Important Notes

- **Race Conditions:** Care should be taken to avoid race conditions where multiple threads try to read and write shared data simultaneously. In this code, `B` is written in the first section and read in the second section, which might lead to undefined behavior if not properly synchronized.
- **Thread Safety:** OpenMP directives manage the creation, execution, and synchronization of threads, but the user must ensure the correct usage of shared resources to avoid conflicts.

### Example of Proper Initialization and Use

Here's a complete example, including initialization, to demonstrate the usage of this code snippet properly:

```cpp
#include <opencv2/opencv.hpp>
#include <omp.h>
#include <iostream>

using namespace cv;

int main()
{
    // Initialize matrices A and B
    Mat A = Mat::ones(3, 3, CV_32F); // 3x3 matrix with all elements set to 1.0 (float)
    Mat B = Mat::zeros(3, 3, CV_32F); // 3x3 matrix with all elements set to 0.0 (float)

    // Display initial matrices
    std::cout << "Initial A:\n" << A << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Initial B:\n" << B << std::endl;

    // Parallel sections
    #pragma omp parallel sections
    {
        #pragma omp section
        {
            Mat C = A * 5;
            C.copyTo(B);
        }
        #pragma omp section
        {
            Mat D = B.t();
            D.copyTo(A);
        }
    }

    // Display result matrices
    std::cout << "Modified A:\n" << A << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Modified B:\n" << B << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This example initializes matrices `A` and `B`, applies the parallel sections as described, and displays the initial and modified matrices. Note that the actual correctness of the parallel execution may depend on additional synchronization if needed, as discussed.

### Why do we create parallel sections in OpenCV ?

Based on the provided search results, parallel sections in OpenCV are created to optimize computation and take advantage of modern processor architectures with multiple cores. This is achieved through the use of libraries like TBB (Threading Building Blocks) and OpenMP, which are integrated into OpenCV.
