Link to the problem [26206](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues/26206)

Context of the Problem

The OpenCV build system defaults to displaying the “Release” build type. However, this can be misleading for users of Visual Studio or Xcode, as these generators default to a “Debug” build. The objective is to modify the CMake configuration so that the build type defaults to “Debug” for Visual Studio and Xcode, while keeping “Release” as the default for other generators.

Step-by-Step Guide to Fix the Issue

1. Tools Involved:

	•	Git: Version control system for tracking code changes.
	•	CMake: Build system generator for configuring the project on various platforms (e.g., Unix Makefiles, Xcode, Visual Studio).

2. Fork the Repository:

	•	Navigate to the OpenCV GitHub repository and click the “Fork” button in the top-right corner to create your copy.
	•	Clone your forked repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/opencv.git
cd opencv



3. Create a New Branch for Your Changes:

	•	Create a new branch to keep your work organized:

git checkout -b fix-build-type-message



4. Modify the CMake Script:

You’ll be editing the CMakeLists.txt file to change the default build type.

	1.	Locate the CMakeLists.txt file in the root of your OpenCV repository.
	2.	Find the section around line 108, where it checks the build type (CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE):

if(NOT DEFINED CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE)
    set(CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE "Release" CACHE STRING "Choose the type of build." FORCE)
endif()


	3.	Replace this section with the following logic:

# Default to Release build type if not specified
if(NOT CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE AND NOT CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES)
    set(default_build_type "Release")
    if(CMAKE_GENERATOR STREQUAL "Xcode" OR CMAKE_GENERATOR MATCHES "Visual Studio")
        set(default_build_type "Debug")
    endif()
    set(CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE "${default_build_type}" CACHE STRING "Choose the type of build." FORCE)
    # Message indicating the default build type
    message(STATUS "'${CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE}' build type is used by default. Use CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE to specify build type (Release or Debug)")
endif()



	•	Explanation:
	•	The CMAKE_GENERATOR is used to determine the build system.
	•	If it matches “Xcode” or “Visual Studio,” the default build type is set to “Debug.”
	•	For other generators like “Unix Makefiles,” it defaults to “Release.”

5. Test the Changes:

	1.	Remove the Existing Build Directory (if it exists):
	•	If you have an existing build directory from a previous configuration, remove it to avoid cached settings:

rm -rf build


	2.	Create a New Build Directory:
	•	Create a new directory for CMake configuration and build:

mkdir build
cd build


	3.	Run CMake for Different Generators:
	•	For each generator type, run the CMake command and verify the output message reflects the correct default build type.
	•	For Unix Makefiles:

cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ..

	•	Expected Output:

'Release' build type is used by default. Use CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE to specify build type (Release or Debug)


	•	For Visual Studio:

cmake -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" ..

	•	Expected Output:

'Debug' build type is used by default. Use CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE to specify build type (Release or Debug)


	•	For Xcode:

cmake -G "Xcode" ..

	•	Expected Output:

'Debug' build type is used by default. Use CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE to specify build type (Release or Debug)



6. Commit Your Changes:

Once you’ve tested and confirmed your changes work:

	1.	Check the status of the modified files:

git status

Example output:

On branch fix-build-type-message
Changes not staged for commit:
  modified:   CMakeLists.txt


	2.	Stage the modified files:

git add CMakeLists.txt


	3.	Commit the changes with a descriptive message:

git commit -m "Fix default build type message for Visual Studio and Xcode generators"



7. Push the Changes to Your Fork:

Now that the changes are committed locally, push them to your GitHub fork:

	1.	Ensure you’re on the right branch:

git branch

If you’re not on fix-build-type-message, switch to it:

git checkout fix-build-type-message


	2.	Push the changes to GitHub:

git push origin fix-build-type-message



8. Create a Pull Request (PR):

Once your changes are pushed, create a Pull Request on the main OpenCV repository:

	1.	Navigate to your fork on GitHub.
	2.	Click on “Compare & Pull Request” or go to the “Pull Requests” tab and click “New Pull Request”.
	3.	Fill in the details:
	•	Title: Fix default build type message for Visual Studio and Xcode generators
	•	Description:

This PR addresses the issue of misleading default build type messages in the OpenCV build system.

- For Visual Studio and Xcode generators, the default build type is now set to 'Debug' instead of 'Release'.
- For other generators, the default remains 'Release'.

### Changes

- Modified \`CMakeLists.txt\` to set the default build type based on the generator used.
- Added logic to display a message indicating the selected default build type.

### Testing

- Tested the changes with the following generators:
  - Unix Makefiles: Default is 'Release'
  - Visual Studio: Default is 'Debug'
  - Xcode: Default is 'Debug'

### Related Issue

Fixes [#26206](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues/26206)

### System Information

- **OpenCV version:** 4.11-pre, 5.0-pre
- **Operating System:** macOS or Windows
- **Compiler & compiler version:** Default supplied by Visual Studio or Xcode


	4.	Submit the PR by clicking the “Create Pull Request” button.

9. Respond to Feedback:

After submitting, the OpenCV maintainers will review your changes. Be prepared for feedback:

	•	Watch for comments or requests for changes.
	•	If changes are requested, make them locally, commit, and push to your branch. The PR will automatically update.

Summary of Next Steps:

	1.	Modify CMakeLists.txt to handle build type for different generators.
	2.	Commit your changes locally (git commit).
	3.	Push your changes to your fork on GitHub (git push).
	4.	Create a pull request on the OpenCV repository.
	5.	Respond to feedback and make adjustments as necessary.
