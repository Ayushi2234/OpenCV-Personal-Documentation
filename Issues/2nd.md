### Context of the Problem

From the issue screenshot, it seems that the OpenCV build system shows a message about using the "Release" build type by default. However, when using Visual Studio or Xcode, this message is misleading because the default behavior is different for those generators—they default to "Debug" builds, not "Release." The goal here is to modify the CMake configuration so that the correct build type is displayed based on the generator used.

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Understanding the Tools Involved:**
    - **Git:** Git is a version control system used to track changes in code. Open-source projects like OpenCV are hosted on platforms like GitHub, which use Git to manage contributions.
    - **CMake:** CMake is a build system generator. It helps to configure your project to work with different platforms (e.g., macOS, Windows) and generators (e.g., Makefiles, Xcode, Visual Studio).

2. **Forking the Repository:**
    - Forking a repository means creating a personal copy of the project on your GitHub account. This is the first step to contributing to any open-source project.
    - Go to the OpenCV GitHub page [here](https://github.com/opencv/opencv), and click the "Fork" button on the top right. This creates a copy of OpenCV under your account.
    - Once forked, you'll clone the repository locally using the command:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/opencv.git
    cd opencv
    ```

3. **Creating a New Branch:**
    - It's good practice to make changes in a new branch so that your `main` branch remains clean. You can create a new branch like this:

    ```bash
    git checkout -b fix-build-type-message
    ```

4. **Modifying the CMake Script:**
    - CMake uses a file called `CMakeLists.txt` to configure the build process. In this file, you'll be adding logic to set the default build type based on whether Visual Studio or Xcode is the selected generator.
    - **Understanding the Change**:
      - Right now, the CMake configuration defaults to "Release" unless otherwise specified.
      - For Xcode or Visual Studio, we want to default to "Debug" instead.
      
    Here's the exact code change you'll make in `CMakeLists.txt`:

    ```cmake
    # Default to Release build type if not specified
    if(NOT CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE AND NOT CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES)
      set(default_build_type "Release")
      if(CMAKE_GENERATOR STREQUAL "Xcode" OR CMAKE_GENERATOR MATCHES "Visual Studio")
        set(default_build_type "Debug")
      endif()
      set(CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE "${default_build_type}" CACHE STRING "Choose the type of build." FORCE)
      # Message indicating the default build type
      message(STATUS "'${CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE}' build type is used by default. Use CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE to specify build type (Release or Debug)")
    endif()
    ```

    - This code checks the generator type being used (`CMAKE_GENERATOR`) and sets the default build type accordingly:
      - For Xcode or Visual Studio, it sets the default to "Debug".
      - For everything else (e.g., Unix Makefiles), it uses "Release" as the default.

5. **Testing the Changes:**
    - After making your changes, you should test whether the behavior is correct for different generators. For example:
    
    ```bash
    # For Unix Makefiles
    cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ..

    # For Xcode
    cmake -G "Xcode" ..

    # For Visual Studio
    cmake -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" ..
    ```

    - After running CMake, check if the correct build type message is displayed for each generator.



### Step 6: **Committing the Changes**

After you’ve tested your changes, it’s time to commit them to your local repository.

#### Here’s How to Do It:

1. **Check the Status of Your Changes**:
   Run this command to see which files have been modified:
   ```bash
   git status
   ```

   You should see something like:
   ```bash
   On branch fix-build-type-message
   Changes not staged for commit:
     modified:   CMakeLists.txt
   ```

2. **Stage Your Changes**:
   You need to stage the modified files for commit (i.e., tell Git you want to include these changes in your commit). You do this by running:
   ```bash
   git add CMakeLists.txt
   ```

3. **Commit the Changes**:
   Now, create a commit with a descriptive message about what you've done. For example:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Fix default build type message for Visual Studio and Xcode generators"
   ```

   This will create a commit in your local Git repository.

### Step 7: **Pushing the Changes to GitHub**

Now that the changes are committed locally, you’ll want to **push** them to your fork of the OpenCV repository on GitHub.

#### Steps to Push:

1. **Make Sure You’re on the Right Branch**:
   If you created a new branch earlier (like `fix-build-type-message`), check that you're still on it:
   ```bash
   git branch
   ```

   You should see your current branch highlighted. If not, switch to it:
   ```bash
   git checkout fix-build-type-message
   ```

2. **Push the Changes**:
   Push your local changes to your forked repository on GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push origin fix-build-type-message
   ```

   This will upload your changes to your fork on GitHub, under the branch `fix-build-type-message`.

### Step 8: **Creating a Pull Request (PR)**

Now that your changes are pushed to GitHub, the next step is to submit a **Pull Request (PR)** to the main OpenCV repository.

#### Steps to Create a PR:

1. **Go to Your Forked Repo**:
   - Open your web browser and go to your GitHub account.
   - Navigate to your forked version of the OpenCV repository.

2. **Open the Pull Request Tab**:
   - On your forked repo’s page, you’ll see a notification that your branch has recent commits. You’ll likely see a button to "Compare & Pull Request" on the repository page itself. Click that.
   
   - Alternatively, click on the **"Pull Requests"** tab, then click **"New Pull Request"**.

3. **Fill in the Pull Request Details**:
   - Write a clear title and description for your PR. For example:
     - **Title**: `Fix default build type message for Visual Studio and Xcode generators`
     - **Description**: 
       ```
       This PR fixes the default build type message in CMakeLists.txt. 
       For Visual Studio and Xcode generators, the default build type is set to 'Debug' instead of 'Release'.
       Tested with Unix Makefiles, Xcode, and Visual Studio.
       ```
   - Make sure the base repository is the **main OpenCV repository** and the compare branch is your branch (`fix-build-type-message`).

4. **Submit the PR**:
   - Once you're satisfied with your description, click **"Create Pull Request"**.

---

### Step 9: **Respond to Feedback**

Now that your PR is submitted, the OpenCV maintainers and community will review it. They may request changes or ask questions.

#### Tips for Responding:
- **Keep an Eye on Notifications**: Watch for any comments or feedback on your PR. You’ll receive notifications via GitHub.
- **Make Updates if Necessary**: If they request changes, make the updates in your local repository and push the changes again. They will automatically update your PR.
- **Be Patient**: Reviewers are usually busy, so it might take some time before your PR is reviewed and merged.

---

### Summary of the Next Steps:
1. **Commit your changes** locally (`git commit`).
2. **Push your changes** to your fork on GitHub (`git push`).
3. **Create a pull request** on the main OpenCV repository.
4. **Respond to feedback** from reviewers.
