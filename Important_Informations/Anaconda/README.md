# Getting Started with Anaconda Distribution

Welcome to Anaconda! This guide will help you get started with Anaconda Distribution, which includes conda, Anaconda Navigator, and over 250 scientific and machine learning packages.

## Anaconda Navigator vs. Conda

**Anaconda Navigator** is a desktop application included with every installation of Anaconda Distribution. It is built on top of conda, the open-source package and environment manager, and allows you to manage your packages and environments via a graphical user interface (GUI). This is especially helpful if you’re not comfortable with the command line.

**Conda** is a command-line interface (CLI) program that processes text commands to perform various tasks. On Windows, Anaconda recommends using the Anaconda Prompt CLI to work with conda. macOS and Linux users can use their built-in command line applications.

**Note:** If you installed Miniconda instead of Anaconda Distribution, Anaconda Navigator is not included. You can manually install Navigator by running the command:

```
conda install anaconda-navigator
```

## Free Anaconda Learning Course - Get Started with Anaconda

Learn to use Anaconda Navigator to launch an application, create, and run a simple Python program with Spyder and Jupyter Notebook. Watch our short training videos on Anaconda Learning to get up and running with Jupyter Notebook and JupyterLab, along with several other popular integrated development environments (IDEs).

## An Introduction to Navigator and the Command Line

Navigator and the CLI interact with conda in similar but distinct ways, each with their benefits and drawbacks. Anaconda recommends learning the basics of both to determine what is preferable for your programming workflow. See "My first Python program: Hello, Anaconda!" for a short programming exercise to help you decide which you prefer.
