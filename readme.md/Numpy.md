### NumPy: The Absolute Basics for Beginners

**Welcome to the absolute beginnerâ€™s guide to NumPy!**

**NumPy (Numerical Python)** is an open-source Python library extensively used in scientific and engineering domains. It provides multidimensional array data structures, such as the homogeneous, N-dimensional `ndarray`, and a comprehensive library of functions to operate efficiently on these structures.

## Installation of NumPy

`To install NumPy`, you can use pip, a package installer for Python. Open your command prompt or terminal and run the following command:

```
pip install numpy
```
This will download and install the latest version of NumPy from PyPI. If you're using a different version of Python, replace pip with pip3. 

For example, if you're using Python 3, you would use:
```
pip3 install numpy
```
If you're using a Linux system and encounter issues with package location, you might need to specify the Python version in the command. For Python 3, this would look like:
```
sudo apt-get install python3-numpy
```
Remember to ensure that Python and pip are updated to their latest versions before installing NumPy.

You can also use the `brew`commmand, for eaxmple:
```
brew install numpy
```

`To check if NumPy is installed`, you can run a Python script with the following command:

```python

import numpy
print(numpy.__version__)
````
If the script runs without raising any errors and prints the version number, then NumPy is installed. If the script raises a ModuleNotFoundError, it means that NumPy is not installed or not accessible in your Python environment. In this case, you can follow the previous instructions to install NumPy.

### How to Import NumPy

After installing NumPy, you can import it into your Python code using the following convention:

```python
import numpy as np
```

This widely-used convention allows access to NumPy features with a short, recognizable prefix (`np.`), distinguishing them from other similarly named features.

### Reading the Example Code

In the NumPy documentation, you will encounter blocks of code like:

```python
a = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
              [4, 5, 6]])
a.shape
(2, 3)
```

- Text preceded by `>>>` or `...` represents input, the code you would enter in a script or at a Python prompt.
- Everything else is output, the results of running your code.
- Note that `>>>` and `...` are not part of the code and may cause an error if entered at a Python prompt.

### Why Use NumPy?

Python lists are excellent, general-purpose containers. They are "heterogeneous," meaning they can contain elements of various types, and are quite fast for performing individual operations on a few elements.

However, depending on the data characteristics and operation types, other containers might be more suitable. By leveraging these characteristics, we can improve speed, reduce memory consumption, and provide a high-level syntax for common processing tasks.

**NumPy excels when dealing with large quantities of "homogeneous" (same-type) data that need processing on the CPU.**

### Key Points:

- **Homogeneous Data Handling:** Ideal for large, same-type datasets.
- **Efficiency:** Offers functions that operate efficiently on large datasets.
- **High-Level Syntax:** Simplifies performing common processing tasks.
