## Code-1

```cpp
Mat C = (Mat_<double>(3,3) << 0, -1, 0, -1, 5, -1, 0, -1, 0);
```

1. `Mat` is a data type in OpenCV representing a matrix or image.
2. `C` is the name of the matrix being created.
3. `(Mat_<double>(3,3) << ... )` is a way to create and initialize a matrix using the `Mat_` template:
   - `Mat_<double>(3,3)` specifies that the matrix should have 3 rows and 3 columns, and that each element should be of type `double` (a double-precision floating-point number).
   - The `<<` operator is used to provide the values for the matrix elements in a row-major order. The values are: `0, -1, 0, -1, 5, -1, 0, -1, 0`.

This creates a 3x3 matrix with the following values:

```
  0  -1   0
 -1   5  -1
  0  -1   0
```

```cpp
cout << "C = " << endl << " " << C << endl << endl;
```

1. `cout` is used to print output to the console.
2. `"C = "` is a string literal that will be printed first.
3. `endl` inserts a newline character and flushes the output buffer.
4. `<< " " << C` prints the matrix `C`. The `<<` operator is overloaded in OpenCV to print the contents of the matrix in a human-readable form.
5. `<< endl << endl;` adds two newline characters at the end of the output for better readability.

### Summary

The code creates a 3x3 matrix `C` with double-precision floating-point elements, initializing it with the specified values. It then prints the matrix to the console. The expected output will look like this:

```
C = 
 [  0, -1,  0;
   -1,  5, -1;
    0, -1,  0]
```

## Code-2
```cpp
Mat RowClone = C.row(1).clone();
```

1. `Mat` is a data type in OpenCV representing a matrix or image.
2. `RowClone` is the name of the matrix being created to hold the cloned row.
3. `C.row(1)` accesses the second row (index 1) of the matrix `C`. In OpenCV, indexing is zero-based, so `row(1)` refers to the second row.
4. `.clone()` creates a deep copy of the specified row. This ensures that `RowClone` is an independent matrix and not just a reference to the same data as in `C`.

Suppose matrix `C` is defined as follows:
```cpp
Mat C = (Mat_<double>(3,3) << 0, -1, 0, -1, 5, -1, 0, -1, 0);
```

Matrix `C` would look like this:
```
  0  -1   0
 -1   5  -1
  0  -1   0
```

The second row (index 1) of matrix `C` is:
```
-1   5  -1
```

So, `RowClone` will be a 1x3 matrix with these values:
```
-1   5  -1
```

```cpp
cout << "RowClone = " << endl << " " << RowClone << endl << endl;
```

1. `cout` is used to print output to the console.
2. `"RowClone = "` is a string literal that will be printed first.
3. `endl` inserts a newline character and flushes the output buffer.
4. `<< " " << RowClone` prints the `RowClone` matrix. The `<<` operator is overloaded in OpenCV to print the contents of the matrix in a human-readable form.
5. `<< endl << endl;` adds two newline characters at the end of the output for better readability.

### Summary

The code extracts the second row from matrix `C`, creates a deep copy of this row, and stores it in `RowClone`. It then prints the `RowClone` matrix to the console. The expected output will look like this:

```
RowClone = 
 [ -1, 5, -1]
```

This shows the values of the cloned row from matrix `C`.

This matrix might be used as a kernel for image processing tasks such as sharpening in convolution operations.
