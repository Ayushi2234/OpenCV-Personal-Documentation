## Code-1

```cpp
Mat C = (Mat_<double>(3,3) << 0, -1, 0, -1, 5, -1, 0, -1, 0);
```

1. `Mat` is a data type in OpenCV representing a matrix or image.
2. `C` is the name of the matrix being created.
3. `(Mat_<double>(3,3) << ... )` is a way to create and initialize a matrix using the `Mat_` template:
   - `Mat_<double>(3,3)` specifies that the matrix should have 3 rows and 3 columns, and that each element should be of type `double` (a double-precision floating-point number).
   - The `<<` operator is used to provide the values for the matrix elements in a row-major order. The values are: `0, -1, 0, -1, 5, -1, 0, -1, 0`.

This creates a 3x3 matrix with the following values:

```
  0  -1   0
 -1   5  -1
  0  -1   0
```



## Code-2
```cpp
Mat RowClone = C.row(1).clone();
```

1. `Mat` is a data type in OpenCV representing a matrix or image.
2. `RowClone` is the name of the matrix being created to hold the cloned row.
3. `C.row(1)` accesses the second row (index 1) of the matrix `C`. In OpenCV, indexing is zero-based, so `row(1)` refers to the second row.
4. `.clone()` creates a deep copy of the specified row. This ensures that `RowClone` is an independent matrix and not just a reference to the same data as in `C`.

Suppose matrix `C` is defined as follows:
```cpp
Mat C = (Mat_<double>(3,3) << 0, -1, 0, -1, 5, -1, 0, -1, 0);
```

Matrix `C` would look like this:
```
  0  -1   0
 -1   5  -1
  0  -1   0
```

The second row (index 1) of matrix `C` is:
```
-1   5  -1
```

So, `RowClone` will be a 1x3 matrix with these values:
```
-1   5  -1
```
