This code snippet is also written in C++ using the OpenCV library. Let's break it down:

```cpp
int sz[3] = {2, 2, 2};
```

1. `int sz[3]` declares an array `sz` of three integers.
2. `{2, 2, 2}` initializes the array with the values 2, 2, and 2. This array specifies the size of each dimension of the multi-dimensional matrix that will be created.

```cpp
Mat L(3, sz, CV_8UC(1), Scalar::all(0));
```

1. `Mat` is a data type in OpenCV representing a matrix or image.
2. `L` is the name of the matrix being created.
3. `3` specifies the number of dimensions of the matrix.
4. `sz` is the array that specifies the size of each dimension, so the matrix will have dimensions 2x2x2.
5. `CV_8UC(1)` indicates the type of the matrix:
   - `CV_8U` means that each element in the matrix is an 8-bit unsigned integer.
   - `C(1)` means that each element has 1 channel (i.e., it's a single-channel matrix, like a grayscale image).
6. `Scalar::all(0)` initializes all elements of the matrix to 0. `Scalar::all(value)` creates a `Scalar` with all channels set to the specified value. Since this matrix has only one channel per element, it means all elements will be set to 0.

### Summary

The code creates a 3-dimensional matrix `L` with dimensions 2x2x2, where each element is an 8-bit unsigned integer with a single channel. All elements in the matrix are initialized to 0.

This type of matrix might be used in applications where a multi-dimensional data structure is needed, such as in volumetric image processing or scientific computations involving tensors.
