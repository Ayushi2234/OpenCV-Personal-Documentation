### 2D Point

```cpp
Point2f P(5, 1);
```

1. `Point2f` is a data type in OpenCV representing a 2D point with `float` coordinates.
2. `P(5, 1)` initializes the 2D point `P` with `x` coordinate 5 and `y` coordinate 1.

```cpp
cout << "Point (2D) = " << P << endl << endl;
```

1. `cout` prints output to the console.
2. `"Point (2D) = "` is a string literal that will be printed first.
3. `<< P` prints the coordinates of the 2D point `P`. The `<<` operator is overloaded in OpenCV to print the point in a human-readable form.
4. `endl` inserts a newline character and flushes the output buffer.
5. `<< endl << endl;` adds two newline characters at the end of the output for better readability.

### 3D Point

```cpp
Point3f P3f(2, 6, 7);
```

1. `Point3f` is a data type in OpenCV representing a 3D point with `float` coordinates.
2. `P3f(2, 6, 7)` initializes the 3D point `P3f` with `x` coordinate 2, `y` coordinate 6, and `z` coordinate 7.

```cpp
cout << "Point (3D) = " << P3f << endl << endl;
```

1. `cout` prints output to the console.
2. `"Point (3D) = "` is a string literal that will be printed first.
3. `<< P3f` prints the coordinates of the 3D point `P3f`. The `<<` operator is overloaded in OpenCV to print the point in a human-readable form.
4. `endl` inserts a newline character and flushes the output buffer.
5. `<< endl << endl;` adds two newline characters at the end of the output for better readability.

### std::vector via cv::Mat

```cpp
vector<float> v;
```

1. `vector<float>` is a `std::vector` that holds `float` values.
2. `v` is the name of the vector being created.

```cpp
v.push_back((float)CV_PI); v.push_back(2); v.push_back(3.01f);
```

1. `v.push_back((float)CV_PI);` adds the value of `CV_PI` (π) to the end of the vector `v`.
2. `v.push_back(2);` adds the value `2` to the end of the vector `v`.
3. `v.push_back(3.01f);` adds the value `3.01f` to the end of the vector `v`.

```cpp
cout << "Vector of floats via Mat = " << Mat(v) << endl << endl;
```

1. `cout` prints output to the console.
2. `"Vector of floats via Mat = "` is a string literal that will be printed first.
3. `<< Mat(v)` converts the `std::vector` `v` to an OpenCV `Mat` and prints it. The `<<` operator is overloaded in OpenCV to print the matrix in a human-readable form.
4. `endl` inserts a newline character and flushes the output buffer.
5. `<< endl << endl;` adds two newline characters at the end of the output for better readability.

### std::vector of points

```cpp
vector<Point2f> vPoints(20);
```

1. `vector<Point2f>` is a `std::vector` that holds `Point2f` values.
2. `vPoints(20)` creates a vector named `vPoints` with 20 elements of type `Point2f`.

```cpp
for (size_t i = 0; i < vPoints.size(); ++i)
    vPoints[i] = Point2f((float)(i * 5), (float)(i % 7));
```

1. `for (size_t i = 0; i < vPoints.size(); ++i)` iterates over each element in the vector `vPoints`.
2. `vPoints[i] = Point2f((float)(i * 5), (float)(i % 7));` initializes each element in the vector `vPoints` with a `Point2f` where the `x` coordinate is `i * 5` and the `y` coordinate is `i % 7`.

```cpp
cout << "A vector of 2D Points = " << vPoints << endl << endl;
```

1. `cout` prints output to the console.
2. `"A vector of 2D Points = "` is a string literal that will be printed first.
3. `<< vPoints` prints the vector of 2D points `vPoints`. The `<<` operator is overloaded in OpenCV to print the vector of points in a human-readable form.
4. `endl` inserts a newline character and flushes the output buffer.
5. `<< endl << endl;` adds two newline characters at the end of the output for better readability.

### Summary

- A 2D point `P` is created with coordinates (5, 1) and printed.
- A 3D point `P3f` is created with coordinates (2, 6, 7) and printed.
- A `std::vector` of `float` values `v` is created, populated with the values π, 2, and 3.01, and printed as an OpenCV `Mat`.
- A `std::vector` of `Point2f` values `vPoints` with 20 elements is created, populated with specific `x` and `y` coordinates based on the loop index, and printed.
