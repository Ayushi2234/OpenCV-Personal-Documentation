The line `img[dst > 0.01 * dst.max()] = [0, 0, 255]` is used to highlight the detected corners in the image by changing the color of those pixels to red.

Here's a breakdown of what this line does:

1. **`dst > 0.01 * dst.max()`**: 
   - `dst` is the output of the Harris corner detection (`cv.cornerHarris`).
   - `dst.max()` gives the maximum value in the `dst` array, which represents the strongest detected corner.
   - `0.01 * dst.max()` calculates 1% of the maximum corner response value.
   - `dst > 0.01 * dst.max()` creates a boolean mask where all values in `dst` greater than 1% of the maximum value are marked as `True`, and others as `False`. This mask essentially highlights the strong corners in the image.

2. **`img[dst > 0.01 * dst.max()]`**:
   - This uses the boolean mask created in the previous step to index into `img`. 
   - It selects all the pixels in `img` that correspond to `True` values in the mask, i.e., the pixels where strong corners are detected.

3. **`= [0, 0, 255]`**:
   - This assigns the color `[0, 0, 255]` to the selected pixels. In BGR color space (used by OpenCV), `[0, 0, 255]` represents the color red.
   - So, all pixels in `img` where the mask is `True` (strong corners) will be colored red.

**Summary**:
This line identifies strong corners in the image and marks those locations by coloring the corresponding pixels red in the original image.
