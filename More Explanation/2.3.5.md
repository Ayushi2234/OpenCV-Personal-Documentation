The expression `len(images)` is used to determine the number of elements in the list `images`.

### Breakdown:

- **`images`**: This is a list (in the context of your code) that contains image data. The list is created by the `load_images_from_folder` function, which reads images from a specified folder and stores each image as an element in this list.

- **`len()`**: This is a built-in Python function that returns the length of a collection. When applied to a list, it returns the number of elements in that list.

### In Context:

```python
num_images = len(images)
```

- **`len(images)`**: Here, `len(images)` returns the number of images in the `images` list.
- **`num_images = len(images)`**: This assigns the number of images (i.e., the length of the `images` list) to the variable `num_images`.

### Why It's Important:

- Knowing the number of images (or the length of the list) is essential for tasks like looping through the images, checking if there are any images to process, or controlling the flow of a slideshow (as in your code).

### Example:

If the `images` list contains 5 images:

```python
images = ['image1.jpg', 'image2.jpg', 'image3.jpg', 'image4.jpg', 'image5.jpg']
```

- `len(images)` would return `5`.
- This means `num_images = 5`.

This information is then used, for example, to control how many times the loop runs in your slideshow:

```python
for i in range(num_images):
    # This loop will run 5 times because num_images is 5
```

If the `images` list were empty (`[]`), `len(images)` would return `0`, and the program could handle this case appropriately (e.g., by printing "No images to display").
