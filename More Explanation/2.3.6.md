The expression `images[(i + 1) % num_images]` is used to get the next image in the list `images` while ensuring that the index wraps around to the beginning of the list when it reaches the end. Here's how it works:

### Breakdown:

- **`images`**: This is a list containing the images.
- **`i`**: This is the current index in the loop, representing the position of the current image.
- **`num_images`**: This is the total number of images in the list (obtained using `len(images)`).

### The Expression:

- **`(i + 1)`**: This increments the current index `i` by 1, aiming to access the next image in the list.
- **`% num_images`**: This is the modulo operator. It ensures that when `i + 1` exceeds `num_images - 1` (the index of the last image), the result wraps around to `0` (the index of the first image).

### How It Works:

1. **For the First Few Iterations (Normal Case):**

   - If `i = 0` (first image), `(i + 1) % num_images` evaluates to `1 % num_images`, which is `1`. So, it points to the second image.
   - If `i = 1` (second image), `(i + 1) % num_images` evaluates to `2 % num_images`, which is `2`. So, it points to the third image.

2. **Wrapping Around at the End:**
   - If `i = num_images - 1` (last image in the list), `(i + 1) % num_images` evaluates to `num_images % num_images`, which is `0`. This wraps around to the first image.

### Example:

Let's say you have 5 images in the list (`num_images = 5`):

```python
images = ['image1', 'image2', 'image3', 'image4', 'image5']
```

- For `i = 0`: `(0 + 1) % 5` → `1`, so `images[1]` gives `'image2'`.
- For `i = 1`: `(1 + 1) % 5` → `2`, so `images[2]` gives `'image3'`.
- For `i = 4`: `(4 + 1) % 5` → `5 % 5` → `0`, so `images[0]` gives `'image1'`.

### Purpose in the Code:

This expression is used to ensure that during the slideshow, after displaying the last image in the list, the program smoothly transitions back to the first image, allowing the slideshow to loop indefinitely.

So in summary, `images[(i + 1) % num_images]` efficiently manages the transition between images, ensuring that when the loop reaches the end of the list, it wraps around to the beginning without causing an "index out of range" error.
