```python
ret, mask = cv.threshold(img2gray, 10, 255, cv.THRESH_BINARY)
```

This code is using the OpenCV library (often imported as `cv`) to apply a binary threshold to a grayscale image. Here's what each part means:

1. **`cv.threshold`**: This is a function from the OpenCV library used to apply a threshold to an image. It separates the pixel values into two groups based on a threshold value.

2. **`img2gray`**: This is the input image that should already be converted to a grayscale image. Grayscale images have only one channel with pixel values ranging from 0 (black) to 255 (white).

3. **`10`**: This is the threshold value. Pixels with values below this threshold will be assigned the first value (0 in this case, representing black).

4. **`255`**: This is the maximum value to use with the binary thresholding. Pixels with values equal to or above the threshold will be assigned this value (255 in this case, representing white).

5. **`cv.THRESH_BINARY`**: This is the type of thresholding. `cv.THRESH_BINARY` means that the thresholding will convert the image to a binary image where the pixel values will be either 0 or 255.

6. **`ret`**: This is the return value of the threshold function. For simple thresholding operations like this one, it will just be the threshold value used (10 in this case).

7. **`mask`**: This is the output image after the thresholding has been applied. It will be a binary image where pixel values are either 0 or 255.

### Summary

The function `cv.threshold` takes the grayscale image `img2gray` and applies a binary thresholding with a threshold value of 10. As a result:

- Any pixel value in `img2gray` less than 10 will be set to 0 in the output `mask`.
- Any pixel value in `img2gray` equal to or greater than 10 will be set to 255 in the output `mask`.
