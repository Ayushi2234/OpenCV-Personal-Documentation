### Explanation of `os.path.join`

#### Purpose:
- `os.path.join` is used to combine one or more path components into a single path. It handles the different path separators used by different operating systems (e.g., `/` for UNIX/Linux/MacOS, `\` for Windows) automatically.

#### Example:
- Let's say you have a folder named `images` and a file named `photo.jpg`. You want to create a path to this file.

Without `os.path.join`, you might write:

```python
path = "images" + "/" + "photo.jpg"
```

But this is not ideal because:
- It assumes the path separator is `/`, which might not work on Windows (which uses `\`).
- Manually managing separators can be error-prone.

With `os.path.join`, you can write:

```python
import os
path = os.path.join("images", "photo.jpg")
```

#### How `os.path.join` Works:
- **Input**: It takes one or more string arguments representing different parts of a path.
- **Output**: It returns a single string that represents the full path.

```python
import os

folder = "images"
filename = "photo.jpg"
path = os.path.join(folder, filename)
print(path)
```

On UNIX/Linux/MacOS, `path` would be:
```
images/photo.jpg
```

On Windows, `path` would be:
```
images\photo.jpg
```

#### Handling Multiple Arguments:
- You can join more than two parts:

```python
path = os.path.join("home", "user", "documents", "file.txt")
```

This would output:
- On UNIX/Linux/MacOS: `home/user/documents/file.txt`
- On Windows: `home\user\documents\file.txt`

#### Importance:
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Ensures that your code will work on any operating system by using the correct path separator.
- **Readability and Maintainability**: Simplifies code and reduces errors associated with manual path concatenation.

In the context of your code:

```python
img = cv.imread(os.path.join(folder, filename))
```

- `os.path.join(folder, filename)` creates a valid file path by combining the folder path (e.g., `"images"`) with the filename (e.g., `"photo.jpg"`), ensuring the correct path separator is used based on the operating system.
