In the context of plotting with matplotlib, "tick marks" refer to the small marks along the axes that indicate the positions of the numerical values. They help in reading and interpreting the values on the graph.

### X-tick marks and Y-tick marks

- **X-tick marks**: These are the tick marks along the x-axis (horizontal axis). They are typically accompanied by numerical labels that indicate the values at those positions.

- **Y-tick marks**: These are the tick marks along the y-axis (vertical axis). They also have numerical labels indicating the values at those positions.

### Example

Here’s an example of a simple plot with both x-tick marks and y-tick marks:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

plt.plot(x, y)
plt.title('Example Plot')
plt.xlabel('X-axis')
plt.ylabel('Y-axis')

plt.show()
```

In the plot generated by the above code, you will see small marks along the x-axis at positions 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, and along the y-axis at positions 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25. These marks help in determining the values at various points on the plot.

### Removing Tick Marks

To remove the tick marks (and their labels), you can use `plt.xticks([])` for the x-axis and `plt.yticks([])` for the y-axis. This is particularly useful when you want to display images or graphs without any numerical value indicators, to reduce clutter or when the tick marks are irrelevant to the data being displayed.

### Example without Tick Marks

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

plt.plot(x, y)
plt.title('Example Plot without Tick Marks')
plt.xlabel('X-axis')
plt.ylabel('Y-axis')

plt.xticks([])  # Remove x-tick marks
plt.yticks([])  # Remove y-tick marks

plt.show()
```

In this plot, you won’t see any tick marks or their labels on either axis, resulting in a cleaner visualization.

In the provided code snippets, the `plt.xticks([])` and `plt.yticks([])` commands are used to control the appearance of the x and y-axis tick marks in the matplotlib plots.

### Explanation:

- `plt.xticks([])`: This command is used to remove the x-axis tick marks. By passing an empty list `[]` as an argument, it tells matplotlib not to display any tick marks along the x-axis.

- `plt.yticks([])`: Similarly, this command removes the y-axis tick marks by passing an empty list `[]`.

### Why use these commands?

These commands are useful when you want to create a cleaner plot, especially when the tick marks are not necessary for understanding the content of the plot. For example, in image processing, when displaying images, the tick marks might be distracting or irrelevant, so removing them can make the visualization clearer.

### Example in context:

In the code provided:

```python
import numpy as np
import cv2 as cv
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

img = cv.imread('dave.jpg', cv.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)
assert img is not None, "file could not be read, check with os.path.exists()"

laplacian = cv.Laplacian(img, cv.CV_64F)
sobelx = cv.Sobel(img, cv.CV_64F, 1, 0, ksize=5)
sobely = cv.Sobel(img, cv.CV_64F, 0, 1, ksize=5)

plt.subplot(2, 2, 1)
plt.imshow(img, cmap='gray')
plt.title('Original')
plt.xticks([]), plt.yticks([])

plt.subplot(2, 2, 2)
plt.imshow(laplacian, cmap='gray')
plt.title('Laplacian')
plt.xticks([]), plt.yticks([])

plt.subplot(2, 2, 3)
plt.imshow(sobelx, cmap='gray')
plt.title('Sobel X')
plt.xticks([]), plt.yticks([])

plt.subplot(2, 2, 4)
plt.imshow(sobely, cmap='gray')
plt.title('Sobel Y')
plt.xticks([]), plt.yticks([])

plt.show()
```

In each subplot, the `plt.xticks([])` and `plt.yticks([])` commands are used to remove the x and y-axis tick marks. This helps to focus on the images themselves without any distraction from the tick marks, making the visual comparison between the original image and the gradient images (Laplacian, Sobel X, and Sobel Y) easier.
