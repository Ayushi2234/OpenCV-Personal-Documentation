# Affine Transformation Matrix Explanation

## Components

### Alpha (&alpha;) and Beta (&beta;):

- &alpha; = scale &middot; cos &theta;
- &beta; = scale &middot; sin &theta;

These components determine the scaling and rotation:

- `scale` is a factor that scales the image.
- &theta; is the rotation angle in radians.

### Translation Terms:

- The elements (1 - &alpha;) &middot; `center.x` - &beta; &middot; `center.y` and &beta; &middot; `center.x` + (1 - &alpha;) &middot; `center.y` represent translation offsets. These terms ensure that the rotation and scaling are performed around the center point (`center.x`, `center.y`) rather than the origin.

## Effect of the Transformation

- **Scaling**: Adjusts the size of the image.
- **Rotation**: Rotates the image by &theta; degrees around the center point.
- **Translation**: Moves the image such that the center point remains fixed during rotation and scaling.

## Practical Example

If you have an image and you want to rotate it by 30 degrees around its center while scaling it by a factor of 1.2, you would:

1. Compute &alpha; and &beta;:

   &alpha; = 1.2*cos(30°) = 1.2 * $\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}}$

   &beta; = 1.2*cos(30°) = 1.2*0.5

2. Insert &alpha; and &beta; into the transformation matrix along with the center point coordinates.

This matrix is then used in functions like `cv2.warpAffine` to apply the transformation to the image.
