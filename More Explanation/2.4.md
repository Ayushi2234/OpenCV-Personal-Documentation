## What is the difference between a binary mask and gradient mask?

### Binary Masks

A binary mask is a binary image (0s and 1s) that highlights specific regions or objects within an input image.
- It is used to separate and identify areas of interest, such as objects, boundaries, or regions with specific characteristics.
- Binary masks are typically generated using techniques like thresholding, where pixel values above or below a certain threshold are set to 1 or 0, respectively.

`Examples` of binary mask applications include object detection, segmentation, and instance-level annotation.

### Gradient Masks

A gradient mask is a continuous-valued image (gradations of gray or color) that represents the magnitude and direction of spatial gradients within an image.
- It is used to extract features, such as edges, lines, or textures, by emphasizing regions with high gradient values.
- Gradient masks can be generated using various techniques, including image filtering, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), or explicit gradient computation.

`Examples` of gradient mask applications include edge detection, texture analysis, and feature extraction.

### Key differences:

- Binary masks are discrete (0s and 1s), while gradient masks are continuous-valued.
- Binary masks are typically used for object-level segmentation or detection, whereas gradient masks are used for feature extraction or edge detection.
- Binary masks are often generated using thresholding or simple image processing operations, whereas gradient masks may require more advanced techniques, such as CNNs or explicit 
  gradient computation.

In summary, binary masks are used to identify specific regions or objects within an image, whereas gradient masks are used to extract features or emphasize spatial gradients. The choice between binary and gradient masks depends on the specific application and the type of information you want to extract from the image.
