This code is written in C++ and uses the OpenCV library, which is widely used for computer vision tasks. Let's break it down line by line:

```cpp
Mat M(2,2, CV_8UC3, Scalar(0,0,255));
```

1. `Mat` is a data type in OpenCV, representing a matrix or image.
2. `M` is the name of the matrix being created.
3. `(2,2)` specifies the size of the matrix, which is 2 rows and 2 columns.
4. `CV_8UC3` is the type of the matrix:
   - `CV_8U` indicates that each element in the matrix is an 8-bit unsigned integer.
   - `C3` means that each element consists of 3 channels (e.g., for a color image in RGB format).
5. `Scalar(0,0,255)` initializes all elements of the matrix to the scalar value specified. In this case, `Scalar(0,0,255)` means that each element in the matrix will be a 3-channel value with the first two channels (blue and green) set to 0, and the third channel (red) set to 255. This effectively sets all pixels to red.

```cpp
cout << "M = " << endl << " " << M << endl << endl;
```

1. `cout` is used to print output to the console.
2. `"M = "` is a string literal that will be printed first.
3. `endl` is an output manipulator that inserts a newline character and flushes the output buffer.
4. `<< " " << M` prints the matrix `M`. The `<<` operator is overloaded in OpenCV to print the contents of the matrix in a human-readable form.
5. `<< endl << endl;` adds two newline characters at the end of the output for better readability.

### Summary

The code creates a 2x2 matrix `M` with three channels per element, where each element is an 8-bit unsigned integer. All elements are initialized to the color red (0, 0, 255 in BGR format). It then prints the matrix to the console. The expected output will look like this:

```
M =
 [  0,   0, 255,   0,   0, 255;
    0,   0, 255,   0,   0, 255]
```

This output shows the values of the matrix elements, with each element consisting of three values corresponding to the BGR color channels.
